## üü° Areas Requiring Attention

### 1. **API Performance Optimization** ‚ö†Ô∏è Priority: HIGH
**Issue**: API response times significantly exceed 100ms target

| Endpoint | Current Performance | Target | Status |
|----------|-------------------|---------|---------|
| `/api/threat/detect-realtime` | 1,227ms | <100ms | ‚ùå 12x slower |
| `/api/threat/analyze-behavior` | 1,761ms | <100ms | ‚ùå 17x slower |
| `/api/threat/query-intelligence` | 1,665ms | <100ms | ‚ùå 16x slower |
| `/api/threat/correlate-threats` | 1,803ms | <100ms | ‚ùå 18x slower |

**Root Causes Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Redis caching is operational (0% initial hit rate expected for new cache)
- ‚úÖ Database queries are optimized (composite indexes implemented)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Likely cause: CPU-intensive threat analysis algorithms without optimization
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential cause: Synchronous processing without async optimization

**Recommended Fixes**:
1. **Implement async processing**: Use worker threads for CPU-intensive operations
2. **Add response streaming**: Stream results as they're computed
3. **Optimize ML algorithms**: Cache computation results, use faster algorithms
4. **Database connection pooling**: Ensure optimal database performance

### 2. **Threat Detection Algorithm Refinement** ‚ö†Ô∏è Priority: MEDIUM
**Issue**: Threat detection returning 0 threats for malicious test data

**Current Behavior**:
- Risk score calculation: ‚úÖ Working (returns numerical scores)
- Event processing: ‚úÖ Working (accepts and processes events)
- Threat identification: ‚ùå Not identifying threats in test scenarios

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Review threat detection logic for sensitivity thresholds
2. Implement more comprehensive threat signatures
3. Add machine learning model training with sample malicious data
4. Validate threat detection patterns against known attack vectors

### 3. **Environment Configuration** ‚ö†Ô∏è Priority: MEDIUM
**Issue**: Missing environment variables in test configuration

**Missing Variables**:
- `NODE_ENV`: Not set (should be 'production' or 'development')
- `JWT_SECRET`: Using hardcoded test secret
- `REDIS_URL`: Not set (using default connection)

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Create comprehensive `.env.example` file
2. Add environment variable validation at startup
3. Implement secure environment configuration for production

### 4. **Rate Limiting Activation** ‚ö†Ô∏è Priority: LOW
**Issue**: Rate limiting not triggered during rapid request testing

**Current Status**:
- Rate limiting middleware: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Rate limiting detection: ‚ùå Not activated during 20 rapid requests
- Security impact: üü° Low (authentication still required)

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Review rate limiting configuration and thresholds
2. Test with more aggressive request patterns
3. Ensure rate limiting is active for production deployment
