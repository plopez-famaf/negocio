## 🚨 **Priority 1: Performance Optimization (CRITICAL)**

### **Issue**: API Response Time Optimization
**Current Performance**: 1200-1800ms (Target: <100ms)  
**Impact**: User experience significantly affected  
**Status**: ⚠️ **FUNCTIONAL BUT SLOW**

#### **Root Cause Analysis**
```javascript
// Current bottlenecks identified:
- CPU-intensive threat analysis algorithms (1200-1800ms)
- Synchronous processing blocking request threads
- No async optimization for machine learning computations
- Missing result streaming for long-running operations
```

#### **Performance Optimization Tasks**

**Task 1.1: Async Processing Implementation**
```bash
# Status: PENDING
# Timeline: 1-2 weeks
# Impact: 60-80% performance improvement expected

Priority: CRITICAL
Files to modify:
- src/services/threat-detection-service.ts (lines 150-300)
- src/routes/threat.ts (lines 40-280)
```

**Task 1.2: Algorithm Optimization**
```typescript
// Current synchronous processing:
async detectThreats(events) {
  // This takes 1200-1800ms
  return await heavyAnalysis(events);
}

// Target asynchronous processing:
async detectThreats(events) {
  // This should take <100ms with streaming
  return await Promise.all([
    quickThreatScan(events),
    streamHeavyAnalysis(events)  // Background processing
  ]);
}
```

**Task 1.3: Result Streaming Implementation**
- **WebSocket streaming for real-time results**
- **Progressive result delivery**
- **Background job processing**

---

## 🔄 **Priority 2: WebSocket Redis Pub/Sub Integration**

### **Issue**: WebSocket Event Distribution
**Current Status**: ⚠️ **PENDING IMPLEMENTATION**  
**Impact**: Scalability limitation for multiple service instances

#### **WebSocket Pub/Sub Tasks**

**Task 2.1: Redis Pub/Sub Integration**
```bash
# Status: PENDING (in todo list)
# Timeline: 3-5 days
# Files: src/services/websocket-stream-service.ts

Implementation needed:
- Redis pub/sub channels for threat events
- Multi-instance WebSocket synchronization
- Event distribution across connected clients
```

**Task 2.2: Real-time Event Broadcasting**
```typescript
// Current: Direct WebSocket emission
socket.emit('threat-event', event);

// Target: Redis pub/sub broadcasting
redisClient.publish('threat-events', JSON.stringify(event));
// All instances receive and broadcast to their clients
```

---

## 🧠 **Priority 3: AI/ML Enhancement (MEDIUM)**

### **Issue**: Threat Detection Algorithm Refinement
**Current Status**: ⚠️ **DETECTING 0 THREATS IN TEST SCENARIOS**  
**Impact**: Core functionality not optimal

#### **AI Enhancement Tasks**

**Task 3.1: Threat Detection Sensitivity**
```javascript
// Current algorithm returns 0 threats for malicious test data
// Need to adjust detection thresholds and patterns

Files to enhance:
- src/services/threat-detection-service.ts (detection logic)
- Threat pattern databases
- Machine learning model parameters
```

**Task 3.2: Behavioral Analysis Improvement**
```typescript
// Current: Basic pattern recognition
// Target: Advanced ML-based behavioral analysis
- Implement anomaly detection algorithms
- Add user behavior baseline learning
- Enhance pattern correlation
```

## 🏗️ **Priority 6: Architecture Enhancements (FUTURE)**

### **Microservices Evolution**
**Current**: Monolithic threat detection service  
**Target**: Distributed microservices architecture

**Task 6.1: Service Decomposition**
```bash
# Future architecture:
bg-threat-ai/
├── threat-detection-service/    # Core threat detection
├── behavioral-analysis-service/ # User behavior analysis
├── intelligence-service/        # Threat intelligence
├── correlation-service/         # Event correlation
└── api-gateway/                # Service orchestration
```

**Task 6.2: Event-Driven Architecture**
```bash
# Implementation: Apache Kafka or Redis Streams
- Asynchronous event processing
