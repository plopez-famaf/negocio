### Key Architectural Patterns

#### App Router Structure
- Uses Next.js 14 App Router with route groups for organization
- **Route Groups**: `(auth)`, `(dashboard)`, `(admin)`, `marketing/`
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware in `src/middleware.ts` handles authentication
- **Layouts**: Nested layouts provide security and UI context
- **Path Aliases**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*` for clean imports

#### Component Organization
- **UI Components**: Base design system in `src/components/ui/` (Button, Card variants)
- **Layout Components**: Header, Footer, Sidebar navigation
- **Feature Components**: Domain-specific components per route group
- **Utility Pattern**: `cn()` utility for conditional classes (clsx + tailwind-merge)

#### Authentication & Security Architecture
- **Supabase Auth**: Complete auth flow with custom UI in `(auth)` route group
- **Middleware Protection**: Route-based access control in `src/middleware.ts`
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive headers via `src/lib/security/security-headers.ts`
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based validation for state changes
- **Rate Limiting**: Memory-based + Redis distributed limiting

#### Caching Architecture (Phase 3A/3B)
- **API Response Caching**: TTL-based in-memory cache with tag invalidation
- **Distributed Caching**: Redis adapter for cross-instance cache sharing
- **Image Optimization**: Custom pipeline with WebP/AVIF generation
- **Cache Layers**: Memory → Redis → Database fallback pattern

#### Monitoring & Observability Architecture (Phase 3A ✅)
- **Structured Logging**: Correlation IDs in `src/lib/monitoring/logger.ts`
- **Performance Monitoring**: APM patterns in `src/lib/monitoring/performance.ts`
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration in `src/lib/monitoring/sentry.ts`
- **Health Checks**: API endpoint at `/api/health/route.ts`
- **Audit Logging**: Database change tracking with triggers

#### Library Organization Pattern
- **Core Libraries**: Organized by domain in `src/lib/`
  - `auth/` - Authentication and session management
  - `monitoring/` - Logging, performance, error tracking
  - `security/` - Rate limiting, CSRF, input validation
  - `caching/` - API cache, Redis adapters
  - `validation/` - Zod schemas and sanitization
  - `database/` - Query monitoring and optimization

#### Testing Architecture (Phase 3A ✅)
- **Unit Tests**: Vitest in `src/__tests__/` with domain structure
- **Integration Tests**: API route and database testing
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for full user flows
- **Testing Scripts**: Automated validation in `scripts/`

### Security Considerations (Phase 3A ✅ Implemented)
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based validation for state-changing requests ✅
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options ✅
- **Rate Limiting**: Memory-based store with configurable limits ✅
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schemas with sanitization ✅
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS prevention, HTML/script tag removal ✅
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input filtering ✅
- **Environment Variable Validation**: Runtime checks and secure defaults ✅
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all database changes ✅

### Performance Optimizations (Phase 3A ✅ Implemented)
- **Image Optimization**: Custom pipeline with WebP/AVIF support ✅
- **Responsive Images**: Breakpoint-aware image generation ✅
- **API Response Caching**: TTL-based with tag invalidation ✅
- **Database Optimization**: Composite indexes for query performance ✅
- **Query Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking ✅
- **Font Optimization**: next/font with display swap ✅
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading and dynamic imports ✅
- **Static Generation**: Marketing content pre-rendered ✅
- **Bundle Optimization**: Package imports and tree shaking ✅

#### Phase 3B External Services Patterns (✅ Ready)
- **Redis Integration**: Distributed caching via `src/lib/cache/redis-adapter.ts`
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time features via Socket.IO in `scripts/websocket-server.js`
- **CDN Management**: Asset optimization via `src/lib/cdn/cdn-manager.ts`
- **Session Store**: Redis-backed sessions in `src/lib/auth/redis-session-store.ts`
- **Distributed Rate Limiting**: Redis-based limiting in `src/lib/security/redis-rate-limiter.ts`

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing features in this codebase:

1. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use existing libraries and architectural patterns
2. **Security First**: All inputs must use Zod validation and sanitization
3. **Monitoring Required**: Every feature needs structured logging with correlation IDs
4. **Cache Strategy**: Implement TTL-based caching for performance-critical operations
5. **Error Handling**: Use centralized error tracking with Sentry integration
6. **Testing Coverage**: Write unit tests for utilities, integration tests for APIs
7. **Type Safety**: Define comprehensive TypeScript interfaces using established patterns

## Testing Patterns & Best Practices

### Unit Testing (Vitest)
```bash
npm run test                    # Run all unit tests
npm run test -- --watch        # Watch mode for development
npm run test -- --coverage     # Generate coverage report
npm run test -- schemas        # Run specific test file
```

### Test File Patterns
- **Location**: Tests in `src/__tests__/` mirroring `src/lib/` structure
- **Naming**: `[module-name].test.ts` for individual modules
- **Structure**: Group tests by functionality using `describe()` blocks
- **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies (Supabase, Redis, etc.)

### Integration Testing
- **API Routes**: Test endpoints in isolation using Next.js test helpers
- **Database**: Use test database or mock Supabase client
- **External Services**: Mock Redis, Stripe, and other external dependencies

### E2E Testing (Playwright)
```bash
npm run test:e2e                # Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e -- --ui        # Interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e -- --headed    # Run in headed browser
```

## Architectural Decision Guidelines

### When to Use Each Caching Layer
1. **Memory Cache**: Fast, frequently accessed data (user sessions, feature flags)
2. **Redis Cache**: Shared data across instances (user preferences, computed results)
3. **Database**: Persistent data with complex queries (user data, transactions)

### Error Handling Patterns
- **Client Errors**: Use structured error responses with error codes
- **Server Errors**: Log with correlation IDs, capture in Sentry
- **Validation Errors**: Return detailed Zod validation results
- **Auth Errors**: Specific auth error types with clear user messaging

### Performance Optimization Decision Tree
1. **Database**: Add composite indexes for frequent query patterns
2. **API**: Implement TTL-based caching for expensive operations
3. **Images**: Use optimized pipeline with WebP/AVIF formats
4. **Bundle**: Leverage Next.js code splitting and dynamic imports

### Common Development Workflows

#### Adding a New API Route
1. Create route file in `src/app/api/[endpoint]/route.ts`
2. Add Zod validation schema in `src/lib/validation/schemas.ts`
3. Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
4. Add error handling with Sentry integration
5. Implement caching if operation is expensive
6. Write unit tests in `src/__tests__/api/`

#### Adding a New Library Module
1. Create module in appropriate `src/lib/[domain]/` directory
2. Define TypeScript interfaces and types
3. Implement core functionality with error handling
4. Add structured logging for important operations
5. Write comprehensive unit tests
6. Export from module index if needed

#### Adding Authentication to a Route
1. Check middleware patterns in `src/middleware.ts`
2. Use `useAuth()` hook for client components
3. Implement server-side auth checks for API routes
4. Add role-based access control if needed
5. Log auth events for monitoring

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Site URL for redirects and metadata
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe secret key for payments
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string (Phase 3B)
- `SENTRY_DSN` - Sentry error tracking DSN

## File Structure Priority

When implementing, create in this order:
1. Core configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`)
2. Base UI components and utilities
3. Layout components (header, footer)
4. Homepage and key marketing pages
5. Forms and API routes
6. Blog system and content management
7. Authentication flow
8. Analytics and tracking
