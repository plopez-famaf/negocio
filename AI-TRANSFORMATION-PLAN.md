# 🤖 AI-Driven Identity Verification & Threat Detection - Transformation Plan

## 📊 **Current Status: Planning Complete**
**Date**: February 2025  
**Phase**: Pre-Implementation Planning  
**Decision**: Multi-Project Microservices Architecture  
**Foundation**: Leveraging existing robust bg-web platform

---

## 🎯 **Transformation Vision**

Transform the current cybersecurity SaaS platform into an **AI-Driven Identity Verification and Threat Detection** system while maintaining all existing functionality and leveraging the robust Phase 3 architecture.

### **Current Platform Strengths (Phase 3 Complete)**
- ✅ Enterprise-grade security (CSRF, rate limiting, input sanitization)  
- ✅ Comprehensive monitoring (structured logging, health checks, performance tracking)
- ✅ Robust caching (multi-layer with Redis support)
- ✅ Real-time capabilities (WebSocket infrastructure)
- ✅ 90%+ test coverage with comprehensive test procedures
- ✅ Database optimization with composite indexes
- ✅ Production-ready with advanced observability

---

## 🏗️ **Multi-Project Architecture Decision**

### **Strategic Approach: Divide & Conquer**
Instead of a monolithic refactor, create **5 specialized projects** that work together:

```
AI Ecosystem Architecture
├── bg-web (Current) ✅          → Core Platform & API Gateway
├── bg-identity-ai 🆕           → AI Identity Verification Service  
├── bg-threat-ai 🆕             → Real-time Threat Detection Engine
├── bg-ai-dashboard 🆕          → AI Monitoring & Analytics Interface
├── bg-mobile-ai 🆕             → Mobile Biometric Verification App
└── Shared Infrastructure       → Redis, PostgreSQL, Event Bus
```

### **Benefits of Multi-Project Approach**
- **🎯 Focus**: Each team specializes in one AI domain
- **⚡ Speed**: Parallel development reduces timeline by 25%
- **🔧 Flexibility**: Optimal tech stack per service (Python/ML, Go/Performance, React/UI)
- **🛡️ Risk Management**: Isolated failures, gradual feature rollout
- **📈 Scalability**: Independent scaling based on service demand

## 🛠️ **Technical Architecture Details**

### **Service Communication Pattern**
```typescript
// bg-web acts as central API Gateway
AI Service Flow:
1. User Request → bg-web (Authentication & Routing)
2. bg-web → AI Service (JWT Token + Request)  
3. AI Service → Processing (ML Models, Analytics)
4. AI Service → Event Bus (Status Updates)
5. AI Service → bg-web (Response)
6. bg-web → User (Final Response)
```

### **Data Architecture**
```sql
-- Extended PostgreSQL Schema
├── ai_identity.*          -- Biometric verification data
├── ai_threat.*           -- Threat detection events  
├── ai_ml.*               -- ML model performance metrics
└── ai_communications.*   -- Service interaction audit
```

### **Event-Driven Architecture**
```typescript
// Redis Pub/Sub Events
AI Events:
├── identity.verification.started
├── identity.verification.completed  
├── threat.detected
├── threat.resolved
├── model.retrained
└── anomaly.detected
